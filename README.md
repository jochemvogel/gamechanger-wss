# GameChanger WSS

I'll add some more description later on. For now: open `app.js` to see how the socket works.

I have a server side application and because of that I wasn't be able to do everything in the same project. I'm sure that it's possible, but on the other hand for me it's more clear to separate the app and the websocket.
